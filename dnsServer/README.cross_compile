Makefile.cross was made to build the dns server for Chromecast.
Since I don't have a toolchain for CC it was built using android toolchain with static linking.

The make file requires the following environment variables
CROSS_SYSROOT, GNUSTL

You may need to edit the Makefile.cross for your environment.

To build, run "make -f Makefile.cross"
